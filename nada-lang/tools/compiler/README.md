# Nillion compiler

This tool takes a textual representation of a circuit and emits a binary representation of it. This can be used to manually build circuits in a human readable format, and then turn them into a binary file that can be fed into the Nillion Network.

# Usage

This tool takes the following parameters:

* `--code-file=PATH`: the path to the file that contains the circuit to be compiled.
* `--output-file=PATH`: the path where the generated binary representation of the circuit will be stored.
