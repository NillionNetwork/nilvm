# This defines the strategy this test uses when incrementing workers.
#
# In this example we start with 5 workers and add 3 more every 2 seconds.
mode:
  # Use manual mode, where you get to define how the number of workers are incremented.
  type: Manual

  # The initial number of workers.

  # The interval at which we increment the number of workers.
  worker_increment_frequency: 2s

  # The amount of workers we add every time.

# The policy used when a flow encounters an error.
#
# Valid values are:
# - AlwaysStop: stop the test regardless of the error type.
# - StopOnPreprocessingExhausted (default): stop when the network runs out of preprocessing elements.
# - Ignore: ignore the error and continue.
error_policy: StopOnPreprocessingExhausted

# The maximum average flow duration. If flows are taking over 1 second to run, the test will be stopped.
#
# This is optional and defaults to 5 seconds if not set.

# The maximum error rate. If the error rate goes over this number, the load test will stop.
max_error_rate: 0.1

# The required starting balance for every nilchain client, in unils.
