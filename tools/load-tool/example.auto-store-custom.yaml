# This defines the strategy this test uses when incrementing workers.
#
# In this example we use the automatic mode. This mode starts at a certain number of workers and progressively adds more
# based on the percentage of the current workers, e.g. 20% more than the current number.
mode:
  # Automatic mode.
  type: Automatic

# The policy to use when starting the testing process.
#
# Valid values are:
# - StartImmediately: start as soon as we can.
# - WaitForPreprocessing: wait until preprocessing pools are full before starting.
start_policy: StartImmediately

# The policy used when a flow encounters an error.
#
# Valid values are:
# - AlwaysStop: stop the test regardless of the error type.
# - StopOnPreprocessingExhausted (default): stop when the network runs out of preprocessing elements.
# - Ignore: ignore the error and continue.
error_policy: StopOnPreprocessingExhausted

# The maximum average flow duration. If flows are taking over 1 second to run, the test will be stopped.

# This is optional and defaults to 5 seconds if not set.

# The maximum error rate. If the error rate goes over this number, the load test will stop.
